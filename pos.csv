1,69,"How to do it: For this position, one partner lies down, flat on their back. The other climbs on top, so they're facing away from the other person's upper body. This creates the illusion of the number 69. (Get it?) Your genitals should be lined up with your partner's mouth, and vice versa. Alternatively, try it in a side-by-side position.","Sure, the mouth-to-genitals stuff is the main attraction, but don't shy away from getting handsy, too. Folks on the bottom can get a better angle to their partner's genitals by using a sex wedge such as the Dame Pillo, says Donna Oriowo, PhD, a licensed sex therapist and owner and lead therapist at AnnodRight. The on-top partner might also benefit from a sex toy, such as the Vedo Quaker Anal Vibe, she adds. ""It has a lot of versatility, so you get to engage other senses, which can bring so much more fun,"" says Oriowo.",69.png
2,Corkscrew,"Near the edge of a bed or bench, the receiver should rest on their hip and forearm and press their thighs together.

3,Face-Off,The giving partner sits on a chair or the edge of the bed; the receiver faces them while seated on their lap.,"Let your fingers (and hands) do the talking. Once seated, you both can put your hands anywhere on each other's bodies to make things more interesting.",face-off.png
4,Doggy Style,"The receiver gets on all fours. Then, the giver kneels behind them, with their upper body straight up or slightly draped over the receiver (ya know, like a humping dog).","Vulva owners can stimulate the clitoris with one hand, or ask their partner to do the finger work for them. ""Temperature play can happen here, too!"" says Oriowo. ""Grab an ice cube and slowly run it down the spine of your partner.""",doggy_style.png
5,Pretzel Dip,"The receiving partner lies down on their side. Then, the giving partner kneels between their thighs, straddling their bottom leg. The receiver's top leg then rests on one of the giver's thighs.","Add nipple clamps into the mix or grab an ice cube and use it on your or your partner's nipples, says Oriowo.",pretzel_dip.png
6,Flatiron,"The receiver lies facedown on the bed, legs straight, hips slightly raised. The giver can enter from behind.","This is a great opportunity to nibble or bite on your partner's shoulders and the back of their neck to add additional sensations,",flatiron.png

8,Cowgirl,"The receiver kneels on top, pushing off the giver's chest and sliding up and down their thighs. The receiver can relieve some of the weight from their partner's pelvis by leaning back and supporting themself on their thighs.","Change the depth and pressure by bringing your chests closer together, a.k.a. lean in,"" says Oriowo. ""While you’re leaning forward, take the time to add in some nipple play and neck kisses."" Alternatively, she recommends grinding in directions that slightly differ from what you normally do. Tend to go back and forth? Channel your inner Ariana Grande and go side to side.",cowgirl.png
9,Wheelbarrow,"The receiver gets on their hands and feet and has the giver pick them up by the pelvis. Then, the receiver grips the giver's waist with their thighs.",Try resting on a table or the side of the bed and give your arms a break. ,wheelbarrow.png

11,Magic Mountain,"The giver sits, legs bent, leaning back on their hands and forearms. The receiver does the same and then inches toward the giver until contact is made.",Slide ice cubes down one partner's chest and let the cold water collect at the base of their pelvis.,magic_mountain.jpg

13,Ballet Dancer,"Standing on one foot, the receiver should face the giving partner and wrap one of their legs around the giver's waist while the giver helps support.","If the receiver is really flexible, they can put their raised leg on the giver's shoulder for even deeper penetration or clitoral stimulation during outercourse.",ballet_dancer.png

15,Cross-Booty,"The giving partner enters the receiver from the missionary position, then slides their chest and legs off the receiver's body so their pelvis is in the same location but the limbs form an “X” together.","Use this unique angle to massage their back, butt, or legs.

16,The Caboose,"While the giver sits on the bed or a chair, the receiver backs into the giver's lap and spoons while seated.",,the_caboose.png

Then, you both lean back.","Vulva owners can have their partner use their hand to rub their clitoris, or use your own. Lean back farther for extra G-spot stimulation.",golden_arch.jpg
20,The Seashell,The receiver should lie back with their legs raised all the way up and their ankles crossed behind their own head. The giver enters from a missionary position.,"For vulva owners, have the giver “ride high,” rubbing their pubic bone against your clitoris, or “ride low,” directly stimulating your G-spot with the head of the penis, the strap-on, a dildo, or a finger.",the_seashell.png
21,Butter Churner,"The receiver should lie on their back with their legs raised and folded over so that their ankles are on either side of their head, while the giver squats and dips their penis, strap-on, dildo, or finger in and out.","Have them dribble chocolate syrup or something sweet into your mouth (yes, really).

24,Valedictorian,"From missionary position, the receiver raises their legs and extends them straight out (forming a “V”).",Receivers can try grabbing their ankles. That can give them stability and an added stretch to boost the sensation.,valedictorian.png
25,Spork,"The receiver should lie on their back and raise their right leg so the giving partner can position their body between their legs at a 90-degree angle and enter. The receiver's left leg can lie straight out on the bed or they can bend it to manipulate depth of penetration. For a rear-entry option, the receiver can lie on their stomach, bend one leg, and have the giving partner position themselves in between their legs.",Synchronize your breathing. One of you takes the lead and the other follows so that you inhale and exhale together. The coordinated rhythm opens an unspoken dialogue of intimacy.,spork.png
26,Seated Wheelbarrow,"The giving partner sits at the edge of a bed or chair, while the receiving partner positions themself so their butt is in the giver's lap. Then, the receiver plants their hands firmly on the floor, stretching their legs out behind the giver's waist (it’ll probably work better if the giver supports their partner's thighs) and pump away.","Try rhythmically squeezing your pelvic muscles, to help you both reach a strong climax.",seated_wheelbarrow.png
27,Table Top,"You don’t have to do this one on a table—any surface that hits your partner at crotch height will do. Have the giver enter while the receiver sits or lies at the edge of a table, counter, or bed.","The receiver can bring their legs down and place their feet on their partner's chest, in front of their shoulders. This allows the receiver to control the tempo and depth of thrusts.",table_top.png

(Or, for the truly bold, receivers can hop aboard from the standing position!)",Have the giver push the receiver up against a wall—very carefully.,upstanding_citizen.png
31,The Spider,"Sit on the bed with legs toward one another, arms back to support yourselves. Now move together so that the receiver goes onto the giver's penis or strap-on. The receiver's hips will be between the giver's spread legs, the receiver's knees bent, and feet outside of the giver's hips and flat on the bed. Now rock back and forth.",The receiving partner can grab the giver’s hands and pull themself up into a squatting position while the giver lies back. Or the giver can remain seated upright and pull the receiver against their chest into the Lazy Man position (see below).,the_spider.png
32,The Good Ex,"Sit on the bed facing each other with legs forward. The giving partner’s right leg goes over the receiver's left, and the receiver's right leg goes over the giver's left. Come together so the giver can enter. Now both of you lie back, your legs forming an X. Slow, leisurely gyrations replace thrusting.","Reach out and hold hands to pull together for pelvic thrusting. Also, take turns alternatively sitting up and lying back without changing the rhythm.",the_good_ex.png
33,The Lazy Man,"Place pillows behind the giving partner’s back and have them sit on the bed with legs outstretched. (Got a sex pillow? Break it out!) Now the receiving partner can straddle their waist with feet on the bed. The receiver should bend their knees to lower themself onto their partner, using one hand to direct the penis or strap-on in.

36,The Snake,"The receiver lies down on their stomach, lifting up their butt. (They can also use a wedge or sex pillow to get the angle just right.) Then, the giving partner lies down on top of them and slides in from behind.","Receivers can reach back and wrap their hand around the shaft to help control how deep the giver gets, or they can change up the angle of their butt for the same effect.",the_snake.png
37,Woman Astride,"This position is just like cowgirl, but with a twist. The receiver climbs on top, while their partner enters them from a lying down position. Then, the receiver leans back and places their hands on the bed for support, creating a 45-degree angle with the giving partner's legs.","If you have a vulva, give yourself a hand with the “V stroke”: Make a V with the index and ring finger of one hand and place the fingers on either side of the clitoris with the giving partner's penis, strap-on, or a dildo in between. Push your fingers down in a rocking motion.",woman_astride.png
38,Stand and Deliver,"With both of you standing, the receiver bends over at the waist; the giver enters from behind.","Those with vulvas can ask for clitoral stimulation, or the giver can loosely tie their partner's hands together with a silky scarf.",stand_and_deliver.png
